This project focuses on the classification of images of cats and dogs using machine learning. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether an input image contains a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images containing cats and dogs.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset. It consists of 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 20,000 images used for training and 5,000 for testing.

Model
The model used for this classification task is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are commonly used in image classification tasks because they can learn to identify important features in images, such as edges and textures.

The model architecture used in this project consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers. The output of the final max pooling layer is flattened and passed through several dense layers before being outputted as a binary classification prediction (cat or dog).

Results
The model was able to achieve an accuracy of over 90% on the testing set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying cat and dog images.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project shows that CNNs can be highly effective in classifying images of cats and dogs. With further improvements and optimizations, the model could potentially be used in real-world applications such as pet monitoring systems or animal shelters.
